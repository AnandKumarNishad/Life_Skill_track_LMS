# REST
## Introduction to REST
**RE**presentational **S**tate **T**ransfer **(REST)** is an architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating web services. **REST API** is a way of accessing web services in a simple and flexible way without having any processing.
REST technology is generally preferred to the more robust Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) technology because REST uses less bandwidth, simple and flexible making it more suitable for internet usage. It’s used to fetch or give some information from a web service. 
Web services which follow the REST architectural style are known as RESTful web services. It allows requesting systems to access and manipulate web resources by using a uniform and predefined set of rules. Interaction in REST based systems happen through Internet’s Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).

## Working
A request from client to the server is sent in the form of web URL as HTTP GET or POST or PUT or DELETE request. After that a response comes back from the server in form of resource which can anything like XML, JSON, image or HTML.
